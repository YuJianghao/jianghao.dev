Hey, I'm Yu Jianghao. Or Jianghao, as my friends do.

I'm presently a frontend developer at [@zhihu](https://github.com/zhihu). My primary focus involves crafting SSR web applications using React and TypeScript, both in-browser and hybrid. Another focus is building a flow editing webapp with Reactflow and bpmn from scratch.

Beyond work, I call myself an extreme sports enthusiast, relishing activities such as hiking, skateboarding, snowboarding, climbing, and more. I'm happy to have a teammate if you also enjoy it :p.
